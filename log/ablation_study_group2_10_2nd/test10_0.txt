input = Slice the lettuce, trash the mug and switch off the light switch
1step output = I'm sorry, but none of the available robots have the skills to perform the tasks of slicing lettuce, trashing a mug, or switching off a light switch. The tasks you mentioned require different capabilities that are not present in the current set of robots. If you have any other tasks that match the capabilities of the available robots, please let me know, and I will be happy to assist you.
