- Usable Process list: [Elevator usage, Delivery]
- Extra Description:
    - 'Main Hall', 'Meeting Room1', 'Meeting Room2', 'Meeting Room3', 'Restroom1', and 'Toilet1' are on the 1st floor, 'Laboratory1', 'Laboratory2', 'Laboratory3', 'Restroom2', and 'Toilet2' are on the 2nd floor, and 'Office', 'Restroom3', and 'Toilet3' are on the 3rd floor.
    - For tray 1 to tray 8 to be delivered, you need to detect whether the 'left' direction can be delivered, and from tray 9 to tray 16, you need to detect whether the 'right' direction can be delivered.
    - Starting location is 'Main Hall'.

1. Start 'Main Hall' (1st Floor)
    # next location is 'Meeting Room1', so there is no need for Elevator usage process as it is on the same floor.

2. Location 'Meeting Room1'
    # Start Delivery Process
        - Go to location 'Meeting Room1'
        - Detect left direction of the location
        - Move the robot arm to deliver 'tray1'
        - Fold the robot arm
    # next location is 'Meeting Room3', so there is no need for Elevator usage process as it is on the same floor.

3. Location 'Meeting Room3'
    # Start Delivery Process
        - Go to location 'Meeting Room3'
        - Detect left direction of the location
        - Move the robot arm to deliver 'tray8'
        - Fold the robot arm
    # next location is 'Laboratory2', so there is need for Elevator usage process as it is on a different floor.

4. SwitchFloor from 1st floor to 2nd floor
    # Start Elevator usage Process
        - Go to location '1floorev_front'
        - call the elevator by sending the floor '1' and 'Up' for 1st to 2nd floor.
        - check inside the elevator
        - Go to location '1floorev_in'
        - move elevator to floor '2'

5. Location 'Laboratory2'
    # Start Delivery Process
        - Go to location 'Laboratory2'
        - Detect right direction of the location
        - Move the robot arm to deliver 'tray9'
        - Fold the robot arm
    # next location is 'Restroom2', so there is no need for Elevator usage process as it is on the same floor.

6. Location 'Restroom2'
    # Start Delivery Process
        - Go to location 'Restroom2'
        - Detect left direction of the location
        - Move the robot arm to deliver 'tray6'
        - Fold the robot arm
    # next location is 'Toilet3', so there is need for Elevator usage process as it is on a different floor.

7. SwitchFloor from 2nd floor to 3rd floor
    # Start Elevator usage Process
        - Go to location '2floorev_front'
        - call the elevator by sending the floor '2' and 'Up' for 2nd to 3rd floor.
        - check inside the elevator
        - Go to location '2floorev_in'
        - move elevator to floor '3'

8. Location 'Toilet3'
    # Start Delivery Process
        - Go to location 'Toilet3'
        - Detect left direction of the location
        - Move the robot arm to deliver 'tray2'
        - Fold the robot arm
    # next location is 'Office', so there is no need for Elevator usage process as it is on the same floor.

9. Location 'Office'
    # Start Delivery Process
        - Go to location 'Office'
        - Detect left direction of the location
        - Move the robot arm to deliver 'tray3'
        - Fold the robot arm
    # next location is 'Meeting Room2', so there is need for Elevator usage process as it is on a different floor.

10. SwitchFloor from 3rd floor to 1st floor
    # Start Elevator usage Process
        - Go to location '3floorev_front'
        - call the elevator by sending the floor '3' and 'Down' for 3rd to 1st floor.
        - check inside the elevator
        - Go to location '3floorev_in'
        - move elevator to floor '1'

11. Location 'Meeting Room2'
    # Start Delivery Process
        - Go to location 'Meeting Room2'
        - Detect left direction of the location
        - Move the robot arm to deliver 'tray5'
        - Fold the robot arm
    # next location is 'Main Hall', so there is no need for Elevator usage process as it is on the same floor.

12. Return to 'Main Hall'
    - Go to location 'Main Hall'
