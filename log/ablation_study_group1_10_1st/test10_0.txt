input = Slice the lettuce, trash the mug and switch off the light switch
1step output = To address the given user input, we need to decompose the tasks and allocate them to the appropriate robots based on their capabilities. However, the tasks provided ("Slice the lettuce," "Trash the mug," and "Switch off the light switch") do not align with the available skills and items of the delivery robots described. The robots are designed for delivery tasks and do not have skills related to slicing, trashing, or switching off lights.

Here's a breakdown of the situation:

### DECOMPOSED COMMAND
1. Slice the lettuce.
2. Trash the mug.
3. Switch off the light switch.

### ALLOCATED TASK
- None of the tasks can be allocated to the available robots as they do not possess the required skills or items to perform these actions.

### TASK EXECUTION PLAN
Since the tasks do not match the capabilities of the robots, no execution plan can be formulated with the current setup. The robots are equipped for delivery tasks involving moving to locations, using elevators, detecting locations, and delivering items, but not for slicing, trashing, or switching off lights.

If you have any other tasks that fit within the robots' capabilities, please provide them, and I can assist in creating a task execution plan.
