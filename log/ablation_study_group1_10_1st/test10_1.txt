input = Slice the lettuce, trash the mug and switch off the light switch
1step output = To address the given user input, we need to decompose the tasks and allocate them to the appropriate robots based on their capabilities. However, the tasks mentioned in the input ("Slice the lettuce," "trash the mug," and "switch off the light switch") do not align with the skills or items available to any of the robots described. The robots are designed for delivery tasks and do not have the skills or items necessary to perform slicing, trashing, or switching off lights.

### Decomposed Command
1. Slice the lettuce.
2. Trash the mug.
3. Switch off the light switch.

### Allocated Task
- None of the tasks can be allocated to the available robots as they do not possess the required skills or items.

### Task Execution Plan
Since none of the tasks can be executed by the available robots, no task execution plan can be formulated.

If you have any other tasks that fit within the capabilities of the robots, please let me know, and I can assist in planning those tasks.
