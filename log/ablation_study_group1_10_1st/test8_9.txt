input = Can you patrol to Restricted Area?
1step output = I'm sorry, but based on the information provided, none of the delivery robots have the capability to patrol or access a "Restricted Area." The robots are designed for specific delivery tasks within predefined locations and do not have the skills or permissions to patrol or enter areas not listed in their movable place lists. If you have any other tasks or need assistance with the available locations, feel free to let me know!
