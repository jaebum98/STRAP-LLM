1. Retrieve the Harry Potter book from the drawer.
2. Patrol to 8101.

##### Allocated Task #####
- The task cannot be performed.

The task cannot be performed because none of the available robots have the skill to retrieve an item from a drawer. The available robots can only deliver items they already have, and none of them have a "retrieve" skill or a "Harry Potter book" in their usable item list.
