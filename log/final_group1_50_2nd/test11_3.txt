1step output = ##### Decomposed Task #####
1. Retrieve the Harry Potter book from the drawer.
2. Patrol to 8101.

##### Allocated Task #####
- The task cannot be performed.

##### Explanation #####
The task of retrieving the Harry Potter book from the drawer cannot be performed because none of the available robots have the skill to retrieve items from a drawer. Additionally, the task of patrolling to 8101 is not defined within the capabilities of the available robots, as they are designed for delivery tasks rather than patrolling.
