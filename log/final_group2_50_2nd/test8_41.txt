1step output = ##### Decomposed Task #####
1. Patrol to 8222.

##### Allocated Task #####
- The task cannot be performed.

##### Task Execution Plan #####
- The task cannot be performed because the Surveillance-Robot, which is the only robot capable of patrolling, cannot move to location 8222. The Surveillance-Robot is limited to the locations ['8100', '8101', '8103', '8107', '8109', '8111'] and does not have the skills required to use the elevator to reach different floors.
