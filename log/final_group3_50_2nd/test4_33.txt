- Extra Description
    - Starting location is '8100'.

1. Start '8100' (1st Floor)
    # next location is '8301', so there is need Elevator usage process as it is on the different floor.
    # It can be used because there is an Elevator usage process in the process list.

2. SwitchFloor from 1st floor to 3rd floor
    # Start Elevator usage Process(can use)
        - Go to location '1floorev_front'
        - Prepare for using the elevator
        - call the elevator according to the direction of movement between floors
