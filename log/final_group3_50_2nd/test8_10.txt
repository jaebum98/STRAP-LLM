1step output = ##### Decomposed Task #####
1. Patrol to 8222.

##### Allocated Task #####
- The task cannot be performed.

##### Explanation #####
The Surveillance-Robot, which is the only robot capable of patrolling, can only move to locations on the first floor ('8100', '8101', '8103', '8107', '8109', '8111'). Since '8222' is on the second floor, the task cannot be performed.
