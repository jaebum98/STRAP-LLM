input = Can you patrol to 8222?
1step output = ##### Decomposed Task #####
1. Patrol to 8222.

##### Allocated Task #####
- The task cannot be performed.

##### Explanation #####
The Surveillance-Robot, which is the only robot capable of performing patrol tasks, can only move to locations ['8100', '8101', '8103', '8107', '8109', '8111']. Since '8222' is not within its movable place list, the task cannot be performed.
