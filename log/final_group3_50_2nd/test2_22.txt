- Start location: '8100' (1st Floor)
- Return location: '8100' (1st Floor)
- Visit location list: ['8109'(1st Floor), '8111'(1st Floor), '8101'(1st Floor)]
- Usable Process list: [Elevator usage, Delivery]
- Extra Description:
    - For tray 1 to tray 8 to be delivered, you need to detect whether the 'left' direction can be delivered, and from tray 9 to tray 16, you need to detect whether the 'right' direction can be delivered.
    - Starting location is '8100'.

1. Start '8100' (1st Floor)
    # next location is '8109', so there is no need for Elevator usage process as it is on the same floor.

2. Location '8109'
    # Start Delivery Process(can use)
        - Go to location '8109'
        - Detect left direction of the location
        - Move the robot arm to deliver 'tray1'
        - Fold the robot arm
    # next location is '8111', so there is no need for Elevator usage process as it is on the same floor.

3. Location '8111'
    # Start Delivery Process(can use)
        - Go to location '8111'
        - Detect left direction of the location
        - Move the robot arm to deliver 'tray3'
        - Fold the robot arm
    # next location is '8101', so there is no need for Elevator usage process as it is on the same floor.

4. Location '8101'
    # Start Delivery Process(can use)
        - Go to location '8101'
        - Detect left direction of the location
        - Move the robot arm to deliver 'tray2'
        - Fold the robot arm
    # next location is '8100', so there is no need for Elevator usage process as it is on the same floor.

5. Return to '8100'
   - Go to location '8100'
