- Return location: '8100' (1st Floor)
- Visit location list: ['8109'(1st Floor), '8111'(1st Floor), '8222'(2nd Floor), '8205'(2nd Floor), '8323'(3rd Floor), '8304'(3rd Floor), '8101'(1st Floor)]
- Usable Process list: [Elevator usage, Delivery]
- Extra Description
    - For tray 1 to tray 8 to be delivered, you need to detect whether the 'left' direction can be delivered, and from tray 9 to tray 16, you need to detect whether the 'right' direction can be delivered.
    - Starting location is '8100'.

1. Start '8100' (1st Floor)
    # next location is '8109', so there is no need Elevator usage process as it is on the same floor.

2. Location '8109'
    # Start Delivery Process(can use)
        - Go to location '8109'
        - Detect left direction of the location
        - Move the robot arm to deliver 'tray1'
        - Fold the robot arm
    # next location is '8111', so there is no need Elevator usage process as it is on the same floor.

3. Location '8111'
    # Start Delivery Process(can use)
        - Go to location '8111'
        - Detect left direction of the location
        - Move the robot arm to deliver 'tray8'
        - Fold the robot arm
    # next location is '8222', so there is need Elevator usage process as it is on the different floor.
    # It can be used because there is an Elevator usage process in the process list.

4. SwitchFloor from 1st floor to 2nd floor
    # Start Elevator usage Process(can use)
        - Go to location '1floorev_front'
        - Prepare for using the elevator
        - call the elevator according to the direction of movement between floors
        - check inside the elevator
        - Go to location '1floorev_in'
        - move between elevator floors

5. Location '8222'
    # Start Delivery Process(can use)
        - Go to location '8222'
        - Detect right direction of the location
        - Move the robot arm to deliver 'tray9'
        - Fold the robot arm
    # next location is '8205', so there is no need Elevator usage process as it is on the same floor.

6. Location '8205'
    # Start Delivery Process(can use)
        - Go to location '8205'
        - Detect left direction of the location
        - Move the robot arm to deliver 'tray6'
        - Fold the robot arm
    # next location is '8323', so there is need Elevator usage process as it is on the different floor.
    # It can be used because there is an Elevator usage process in the process list.

7. SwitchFloor from 2nd floor to 3rd floor
    # Start Elevator usage Process(can use)
        - Go to location '2floorev_front'
        - Prepare for using the elevator
        - call the elevator according to the direction of movement between floors
        - check inside the elevator
        - Go to location '2floorev_in'
        - move between elevator floors

8. Location '8323'
    # Start Delivery Process(can use)
        - Go to location '8323'
        - Detect left direction of the location
        - Move the robot arm to deliver 'tray2'
        - Fold the robot arm
    # next location is '8304', so there is no need Elevator usage process as it is on the same floor.

9. Location '8304'
    # Start Delivery Process(can use)
        - Go to location '8304'
        - Detect left direction of the location
        - Move the robot arm to deliver 'tray3'
        - Fold the robot arm
    # next location is '8101', so there is need Elevator usage process as it is on the different floor.
    # It can be used because there is an Elevator usage process in the process list.

10. SwitchFloor from 3rd floor to 1st floor
    # Start Elevator usage Process(can use)
        - Go to location '3floorev_front'
        - Prepare for using the elevator
        - call the elevator according to the direction of movement between floors
        - check inside the elevator
        - Go to location '3floorev_in'
        - move between elevator floors

11. Location '8101'
    # Start Delivery Process(can use)
        - Go to location '8101'
        - Detect left direction of the location
        - Move the robot arm to deliver 'tray5'
        - Fold the robot arm
    # next location is '8100', so there is no need Elevator usage process as it is on the same floor.

12. Return to '8100'
    - Go to location '8100'
