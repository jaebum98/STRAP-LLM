input = Can you patrol to 8222?
1step output = ##### Decomposed Task #####
1. Patrol to 8222.

##### Allocated Task #####
- The task cannot be performed.

##### Task Execution Plan #####
The task cannot be performed because the Surveillance-Robot, which is the only robot capable of patrolling, cannot move to location 8222. The Surveillance-Robot's movable place list is limited to [8100, 8101, 8103, 8107, 8109, 8111], and it does not have the skills required to use the elevator to reach different floors.
