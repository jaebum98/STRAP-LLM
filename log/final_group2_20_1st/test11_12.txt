input = Give me the Harry Potter book from the drawer and patrol until 8101.
1step output = ##### Decomposed Task #####
1. Retrieve the Harry Potter book from the drawer.
2. Patrol until 8101.

##### Allocated Task #####
- The task cannot be performed.

##### Explanation #####
- None of the available robots have the skill to retrieve an item from a drawer.
- The Surveillance-Robot can patrol, but it cannot retrieve items from a drawer. Additionally, the Surveillance-Robot's patrol locations are limited to [8100, 8101, 8103, 8107, 8109, 8111], and it cannot patrol "until" a location as described.
- Therefore, the task cannot be performed as requested.
