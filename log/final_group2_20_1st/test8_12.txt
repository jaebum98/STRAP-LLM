1step output = ##### Decomposed Task #####
1. Patrol to 8222.

##### Allocated Task #####
- The task cannot be performed.

##### Task Execution Plan #####
- The task cannot be performed because the Surveillance-Robot, which is the only robot with the "Patrol" skill, cannot move to location 8222. The Surveillance-Robot is limited to locations [8100, 8101, 8103, 8107, 8109, 8111], and it does not have the skills required to use the elevator to reach different floors.
