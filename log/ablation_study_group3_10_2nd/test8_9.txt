input = Can you patrol to Restricted Area?
1step output = I'm sorry, but none of the available robots have the capability to patrol a location called "Restricted Area." The Surveillance-Robot can patrol specific locations such as 'Main Entrance', 'Server Room', 'Control Room', 'Storage Room', 'Office', and 'Boiler Room'. If you have a task related to these locations, please let me know, and I can assist you further.
