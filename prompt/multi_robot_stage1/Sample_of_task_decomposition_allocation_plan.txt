    - For tray 1 to tray 8 to be delivered, you need to detect whether the 'left' direction can be delivered, and from tray 9 to tray 16, you need to detect whether the 'right' direction can be delivered.
	- Starting location is 'Main Hall'.


1. Start 'Main Hall' (1st Floor)
    # next location is 'Laboratory1', so there is need Elevator usage process as it is on the different floor.
    # It can be used because there is an Elevator usage process in the process list.

2. SwitchFloor from 1st floor to 2nd floor
    # Start Elevator usage Process
        - Go to location '1floorev_front'
        - call the elevator by sending the floor '1' and 'Up' for 1st to 2nd floor.
        - check inside the elevator
        - Go to location '1floorev_in'
        - move elevator to floor '2'

3. Location 'Laboratory1'
    # Start Delivery Process
        - Go to location 'Laboratory1'
        - Detect left direction of the location
        - Move the robot arm to deliver 'tray2'
        - Fold the robot arm
    # next location is 'Meeting Room2', so there is need Elevator usage process as it is on the different floor.
    # It can be used because there is an Elevator usage process in the process list.

4. SwitchFloor from 2nd floor to 1st floor
    # Start Elevator usage Process
        - Go to location '2floorev_front'
        - call the elevator by sending the floor '2' and 'Down' for 1st to 2nd floor.
        - check inside the elevator
        - Go to location '2floorev_in'
        - move elevator to floor '1'
