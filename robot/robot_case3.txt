    - Main task :
        - Delivery Process : Robot Start to starting point, and move to visit location in order. And when robot arrive at each location, detect the location. And move the robot arm to deliver the item. And the robot arm needs to be folded. Finally, when delivery to all destinations is completed, it returns to the start location.
        - Elevator usage Process : If robot's next location is on a different floor, robot must use the elevator. To use the elevator, move to the front of the elevator on your current floor. Then, call the elevator by sending the current floor and 'Up' or 'Down' information according to the direction of movement between floors. When the call is complete, check inside the elevator to see if it is possible to board the elevator. And move robot to inside the elevator, and move elevator to the desired floor.
