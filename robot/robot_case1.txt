    - Usable item List : ['tray1','tray2','tray3','tray4','tray5','tray6','tray7','tray8','tray9','tray10','tray11','tray12','tray13','tray14','tray15','tray16']
    - Movable place List : ['Main Hall', 'Meeting Room1', 'Meeting Room2', 'Meeting Room3', 'Laboratory1', 'Laboratory2', 'Laboratory3', 'Restroom1', 'Restroom2', 'Restroom3', 'Toilet1', 'Toilet2', 'Toilet3', 'Office', '1floorev_front', '1floorev_in', '2floorev_front', '2floorev_in', '3floorev_front', '3floorev_in']
    - Main task :
        - Delivery Process : Robot Start to starting point, and move to visit location in order. And when robot arrive at each location, detect the location. And move the robot arm to deliver the item. And the robot arm needs to be folded. Finally, when delivery to all destinations is completed, it returns to the start location.
        - Elevator usage Process : If robot's next location is on a different floor, robot must use the elevator. To use the elevator, move to the front of the elevator on your current floor. Then, call the elevator by sending the current floor and 'Up' or 'Down' information according to the direction of movement between floors. When the call is complete, check inside the elevator to see if it is possible to board the elevator. And move robot to inside the elevator, and move elevator to the desired floor.
    - Extra Description
        - 'Main Hall', 'Meeting Room1', 'Meeting Room2', 'Meeting Room3', 'Restroom1', and 'Toilet1' are on the 1st floor, 'Laboratory1', 'Laboratory2', 'Laboratory3', 'Restroom2', and 'Toilet2' are on the 2nd floor, and 'Office', 'Restroom3', and 'Toilet3' are on the 3rd floor.
        - For tray 1 to tray 8 to be delivered, you need to detect whether the 'left' direction can be delivered, and from tray 9 to tray 16, you need to detect whether the 'right' direction can be delivered.
    	- Starting location is 'Main Hall'.
